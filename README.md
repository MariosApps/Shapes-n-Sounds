# Shapes'n'Sounds

<h3><a href="https://pampuchskrytozerca.github.io/Shapes-n-Sounds/">DEMO</a></h3>

A simplified version of this app (only circles and sounds) has been created on Udemy's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. I played a little with this code and added a few new shapes nad changable background.

Use A-Z and 0-9 buttons to create different sounds and shapes. 
You can also use Enter or Space button to change background color.

Have fun!
